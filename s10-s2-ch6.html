        <h3>Why is the classification of animals necessary?</h3>
        <div class="point-list">
            <div class="point-item">There are millions of animal species on Earth, making individual study impossible.</div>
            <div class="point-item">Classification helps in identifying animals with great accuracy and ease.</div>
            <div class="point-item">It helps in understanding the relationship between different animal groups.</div>
            <div class="point-item">It provides information about the evolution of animals from simple to complex.</div>
            <div class="point-item">It helps in the systematic study of the entire animal kingdom.</div>

        <div class="point-list">
            <div class="point-item">The Greek philosopher Aristotle was the first to classify animals.</div>
            <div class="point-item">He used a "Artificial Method" of classification based on external criteria.</div>
            <div class="point-item">He classified animals based on their habitat (land, water, or air).</div>
            <div class="point-item">He also considered their body size and habits for classification.</div>
            <div class="point-item">Other scientists like Pliny and John Ray also followed similar artificial methods.</div>
            <div class="point-item">Linnaeus later introduced more refined artificial systems before the natural system.</div>

            <div class="point-item">This method is based on internal and objective biological criteria.</div>
            <div class="point-item">It considers the type of cells (prokaryotic or eukaryotic) and body structure.</div>
            <div class="point-item">It takes into account the chemical composition of the animal body.</div>
            <div class="point-item">Chromosomal similarities and differences are studied in this method.</div>

            <div class="point-item">In this symmetry, the body can be divided into two equal halves by any plane.</div>
            <div class="point-item">The plane must pass through the central imaginary axis of the body.</div>
            <div class="point-item">This is commonly seen in circular or star-shaped animals.</div>

        <div class="point-list">
            <div class="point-item">In this symmetry, there is only one imaginary plane of division.</div>
            <div class="point-item">This plane divides the body into identical left and right halves.</div>
            <div class="point-item">Most animals, including insects, fish, and humans, exhibit this symmetry.</div>
            <div class="point-item">It is associated with "cephalization" or the development of a distinct head.</div>
            <div class="point-item">It allows for streamlined movement and better directional sensing.</div>

            <div class="point-item">The layers are the Ectoderm, Mesoderm (middle), and Endoderm.</div>
            <div class="point-item">The Mesoderm gives rise to muscles, bones, and the circulatory system.</div>
            <div class="point-item">All animals from Phylum Platyhelminthes to Chordata are triploblastic.</div>
            <div class="point-item">This allows for the development of complex organs and a body cavity.</div>

            <div class="point-item">It is formed from the Mesoderm during embryonic development.</div>
            <div class="point-item">It provides space for the growth and movement of internal organs.</div>
            <div class="point-item">The presence or absence of a coelom is a key classification feature.</div>
            <div class="point-item">A true coelom is lined with mesodermal epithelium on both sides.</div>
