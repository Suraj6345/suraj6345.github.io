            <div class="point-list">
                <div class="point-item">The iris is the colored part of the eye that regulates the size of the pupil.</div>
                <div class="point-item">The pupil is the opening that allows light to enter the eye.</div>
                <div class="point-item">This mechanism evolved to protect the retina from excessive light.</div>
                <div class="point-item">It also allows for better vision in low-light conditions.</div>
                <div class="point-item">Complex eyes evolved through millions of years from simple light-sensitive spots.</div>
