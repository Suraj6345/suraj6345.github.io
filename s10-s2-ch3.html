            <div class="point-list">
                <div class="point-item">Reproduction is the process by which a living organism produces a new organism of its own kind.</div>

                <div class="point-item">It does not help an individual to remain alive, but it is essential for the survival of the species.</div>
                <div class="point-item">It ensures the continuity of a particular species over many generations.</div>
                <div class="point-item">Reproduction is responsible for passing genetic information from parents to offspring.</div>
                <div class="point-item">It plays a vital role in the process of evolution by introducing variations.</div>

                <div class="point-item">It is commonly observed in unicellular organisms and some simple multicellular organisms.</div>

                <div class="point-item">In potatoes, it occurs through the "eyes" (buds) present on the tuber.</div>
                <div class="point-item">In Bryophyllum, new plantlets grow from the buds present on the leaf margins.</div>
                <div class="point-item">In plants like sugarcane and grasses, propagation occurs through buds on the nodes of the stem.</div>
                <div class="point-item">Carrots and radishes use their modified roots for vegetative reproduction.</div>

                <div class="point-item">Inside the sporangia, thousands of tiny, dust-like spores are produced.</div>
                <div class="point-item">Once the spores are mature, the sporangium bursts open to release them.</div>
                <div class="point-item">Spores are lightweight and can be carried by air or water over long distances.</div>
                <div class="point-item">When spores land on a moist and warm surface (like bread), they germinate.</div>
                <div class="point-item">Upon germination, a new fungal colony (mycelium) is formed.</div>
